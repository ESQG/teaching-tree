<h1>Welcome to The Teaching Tree!</h1>

<p>The Teaching Tree can help you learn about any of the following subjects.  Once you pick a subject, answer two questions we'll try to recommend a good resource for you!  If you don't like it, come back and tell us why, and we'll try to recommend another one.</p>

<form action="/learn">
    <p> Enter a subject here: <input type="text" name="subject"></p>
    <p> Or pick one: <select>
        {% for subject in subjects %}
        <option name="subject" value="{{ subject }}">
        {% endfor %}
    </p>
    <p><input type="submit" value="I want to learn!"></p>
</form>

All subjects available:
<ul>
    {% for subject in subjects %}
    <li> {{ subject }} </li>
    {% endfor %}
</ul>
